              Availability of large quantities of renewable energy can break the cost curve for large scale computing. For most 
              high performance computing centers, energy is a significant fraction of operating cost, and can reach up to approximately 
              the same cost of computing clusters over the lifetime of the equipment. Wind power and solar energy are increasingly 
              available in the US and worldwide, but unlike previous sources of renewable energy such as hydroelectric plants, 
              each of these has significantly variable availability and cost (sometimes even negative) throughout the day. 
              To make best use of these sources of energy, data centers will need to be highly automated and preferably sited 
              in remote locations near these sources to reduce transmission costs. This project will apply previous CAC work in

             In recent years, a new class of accelerator devices known as data processing units (DPUs) have been designed to 
              accelerate data-intensive workloads. Smart network interface controllers, or SmartNICs, such as the 
              Nvidia Bluefield and Broadcom Stingray series of devices, represent a particularly promising incarnation of DPUs. 
              However, the capabilities and potential use cases of SmartNICs remain largely unknown. Moreover, a unified interface
              for utilizing SmartNICs remains unrealized. The objectives of this proposed project are three-fold. First, we will 
              investigate the capabilities of SmartNIC accelerators, as well as the set of potentially applicable SmartNIC use cases, 
              in order to better understand the SmartNIC functionalities desired by end-users and system architects. Second, using 
              these insights, and consistent with the goals of the OpenSNAPI project, we will then design a unified API for 
              SmartNIC programming. Third, we will work to provide a standard benchmarking methodology for SmartNIC accelerators 
              and SmartNIC-enabled systems that can be incorporated into the OpenHPCA project.

              The growth on Blockchain and Non-Fungible Tokens has revolutionized online marketplace with blockchain 
              technology being used from cryptocurrency, smart contracts, user privacy maintenance, and data management, 
              providing decentralization, immutability and crypto-graphic link. A non-fungible token (NFT) is a unique and 
              non-interchangeable unit of data stored on a digital ledger (blockchain). NFTs can be associated with easily 
              reproducible items such as photos, videos, audio, and other types of digital files as unique items (analogous 
              to a certificate of authenticity) and use blockchain technology to give the NFT a verified and public 
              proof of ownership. Thus, NFTs have found applications in Digital Rights Management (DRM) giving rise to 
              a wide array of problems including, NFT authenticity, NFT Owner Identity Verification, NFT Copyright Authenticity, 
              and NFT Content Tracking. In this research, we propose Non-Fungible Token (NFT) based Digital Rights Management 
              (NFT-DRM), a framework to address NFT authenticity, NFT Owner Identity Verification, NFT Copyright Authenticity, 
              and NFT Content Tracking issues of NFT.

              Side-channel attacks (SCA) have been widely studied over the past two decades, which resulted in numerous techniques 
              that use statistical models to extract systems information from various side channels. More recently, machine learning 
              has shown significant promise to advance the ability for SCAs to expose vulnerabilities in complex systems. Neural 
              networks can effectively learn non-linear relationships between many features within a side channel, which was limited 
              by shallow machine learning algorithms such as SVMs and Random Forests. In this paper, we propose a deep neural network 
              (DNN) approach and multi-architecture data aggregation technique to profile power traces for a system with an embedded processor.

              There is an increasing dependency of individual users, as well as businesses, on secure computers and computer networks. Furthermore, there is also an increase in the threats to them by malicious agents. Thus, there is an urgent need

            The xBGAS project is a collaboration between Tactical Computing Labs (TCL), Texas Tech University (TTU), 
              Arizona State University (ASU), and the University of Cambridge (UC). The goals of the Extended Base Global 
              Address Space (xBGAS) project are three-fold: 1) to provide 128-bit extended addressing capabilities based 
              on the RISC-V architecture without modifying ABI compatibility (e.g. RV64 apps will execute without an issue), 
              2) extended addressing must be flexible to support multiple target application spaces/system architectures, 
              e.g. traditional data centers, clouds, HPC, etc., and 3) extended addressing must not rely upon any one 
              virtual memory mechanism. The overall xBGAS project includes five major tasks: design and development of the 
              ISA extension, design and development of compilers and toolchains to support the xBGAS extended instructions 
              and addressing modes, design and development of runtime libraries, design and development of applications 
              built upon xBGAS, and porting benchmarks.

              Social media users share their experience, feelings, and opinions on Web based social media platforms that can influence

              offer policies against a person’s or a company’s reputation begin damaged due to online attacks. Thus, there is a need 
              for a scalable framework to quantify the impacts of different social media posts on reputation of companies, organizations,

              With the advances in Internet technologies and services, social media has been gaining excessive popularity, 
              especially because these technologies provide anonymity, which harbors spam bots, hacker discussion forums, 
              rogue players, misinformation that can be maliciously manipulated to negative impacts the reputation of 
              targeted business, and/or exploit mistakes or crisis events. In this project, we will leverage the 
              NSF CAC research capabilities that utilize AI, real-time sentimental analysis, autonomic computing, 
              machine learning (i.e., ensemble learning, deep learning, clustering) to identify fake news and the 
              identity of bad actors and social bots who are maliciously aiming at destroying the reputation of targeted businesses. 
              In this research, we apply autonomic social media monitoring events and news, perform novel text feature extraction 
              methods, sentimental analysis to detect and identify the spam bots,  source of fake news and rouge players, then 
              uses Legendary experience to develop effective defense and offensive strategies to manage the detected crisis 
              and minimizes its impact. This project will leverage our ongoing project in detecting anomalous behavior,

              This project aims to develop accelerated solutions of Somewhat Homomorphic Encryption (SHE) based on the Ring Learning with Errors scheme (RLWE). Recent research has identified data movement between host and device as a critical
              performance bottleneck in RLWE-based SHE. Our work will leverage the recently introduced Unified Memory technology and the Coherent Accelerator Processor Interface (CAPI) to develop an algorithm for the organization and placement of
              data within a Hybrid Memory System (HMS). The algorithm will reduce the amount of data movement between the host and the device and overlap remote fetches with computation on the accelerator to minimize exposed latency. The decision of
              when to move data from host to device will be guided by a Machine Learning model. A semi-supervised classifier will be trained offline to learn the relationship between SHE computation and data access characteristics and placement
              configurations. The optimal configuration will then be selected at runtime via autotuning methods. In prior work, we have deployed ML-driven heuristics to optimize accelerated applications where it has yielded integer factor performance
              improvements.

              The advent of ‘smart’ infrastructure systems that integrate digital communications and controls, with human operators as beneficiaries have created more new vulnerabilities than would exist if the sub-systems were isolated from one
              another. Sophisticated cyberattacks can exploit these vulnerabilities to disrupt or even completely disable the operations of our critical infrastructures and their services. The recent embrace of Internet of Things (IoT), autonomous
              driving, and cloud computing will further exacerbate the cybersecurity problem. Anomaly based Intrusion Detection Systems (ABA-IDS) are the go-to approach to detect and secure this smart infrastructure. ABA-IDS heavily depend on
              accurate modeling of the normal behavior of the systems to detect attacks. This modeling of the normal behavior is performed using machine learning techniques. To address IoT security problem not only do we need to train models that are
              highly accurate in anomaly detection but also train models and use machine learning techniques that are highly scalable in order to detect abnormal behavior in large cluster of IoT devices. The main goal of this research project is to
              explore the use of GPUs and other parallel processing techniques to improve the performance (computational) of machine learning models to aid in secure IoT infrastructure.

              Disk arrays spread data across several disks and access them in parallel to increase data transfer rates and I/O rates. Disk arrays are, however, highly vulnerable to disk failures. One of the challenges facing RAID storage technology
              is the growing time needed to rebuild failed disks, which increases the risk of data loss and threatens the long-running data storage technology's viability. When a disk fails, one RAID controller and a handful of disks do all the
              recovery work while the other disks and RAID controllers are not involved in the recovery process. The time it takes to rebuild an 8 TB or larger disk drive can reach several days, depending on how busy the storage system and RAID group
              are. In this project, we will explore declustered RAID, machine learning enabled proactive disk data protection, and vectorized RAIDZ technologies on both HDD and SSD drives to develop always-on HPC storage systems.

              Monitoring data centers is challenging due to their size, complexity, and dynamic nature. This project proposes visual approaches for situational awareness and health monitoring of HPC systems. The visualization requirements are
              expanded on the following dimensions: HPC spatial layout, temporal domain (historical vs. real-time tracking), jobs scheduling data, and system health services such as temperature, fan speed, and power consumption. We therefore focus
              the following design goals: 1) Provides spatial and temporal overview across hosts and racks, 2) Allows system administrators to filter by time series features such as sudden changes in temperatures for system debugging,3) Inspects the
              correlation of system health services and job scheduling information in a single view and 4) Characterize the HPC systems using unsupervised learning and provide predictive analysis.

              capabilities based on RISC-V architecture with ABI compatibility(e.g.RV64 apps will execute without an issue),2)extended addressing must be flexible to support multiple target application spaces/system architectures, e.g. traditional
              data centers, clouds, HPC, etc.,and3)extended addressing must not rely upon any one virtual memory mechanism. The overall xBGAS project includes four major tasks: design and development of ISA extension, design and development of

              This project concentrates on significantly enhancing data durability in data centers without using remote-site data replication (geo-replication) like in existing solutions. It also considers other important characteristics of the
              storage system including load balance and scalability holistically. One of the major research challenges is that some of the existing techniques of improving the correlated-failure durability sacrifices load balance, scalability, and
              numerous other features of the existing storage systems. This project will investigate these issues and create innovative solutions.

              A common trend in Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) is to consider data structures based on graphs to analyze network traffic and attack patterns. Timely detecting a threat is fundamental to reduce the risk to which the system is

              Benchmarking of a system is a process of assessing its performance and other characteristics, to be able to compare them with other systems. There is a strong desire for benchmarking and evaluating Cloud computing systems. Cloud
              computing provides service-oriented access to computing, storage and networking resource. On one hand, considering the number of Cloud computing providers and the different services each provider offers, Cloud users need benchmark
              information to select the best service and provider for their needs. On the other hand, Cloud providers and Cloud architects need benchmarking results to create optimized architectures. The problem is that Cloud is a very complex and
              dynamic environment. Therefore there are important differences between benchmarking in dynamic Cloud environment with traditional benchmarking methods in static systems. We have performed an initial research about benchmarking in Cloud
              and understand various challenges about creating and deploying Cloud benchmarking; and we found that the most important problem for Cloud users are data isolation, security and unreliable performance. Inference and performance isolation

              Emerging large-scale applications on Cloud computing platform, such as information retrieval, data mining, online business, and social network, are data- rather than computation-intensive. Storage system is one of the most critical
              components for Cloud computing. The traditional hard disk drives (HDD) are current dominant storage devices in Clouds, but are notorious for long access latency and failure prone. The emerging storage class memory (SCM) such as Solid
              State Drives provides a new promising storage solution of high bandwidth, low latency, and mechanical component free, but with inherent limitations of small capacity, short lifetime, and high cost. The objective of this project is to
              build an innovative unified storage architecture (Unistore) with the co-existence and efficient integration of heterogeneous HDD and SCM devices for Cloud storage systems.

              components for Cloud computing. The traditional hard disk drives (HDD) are current dominant storage devices in Clouds, but are notorious for long access latency and failure prone. The emerging storage class memory (SCM) such as Solid
              State Drives provides a new promising storage solution of high bandwidth, low latency, and mechanical component free, but with inherent limitations of small capacity, short lifetime, and high cost. The objective of this project is to
              build an innovative unified storage architecture (Unistore) with the co-existence and efficient integration of heterogeneous HDD and SCM devices for Cloud storage systems.

              Benchmarking of a system is a process of assessing its performance and other characteristics, to be able to compare them with other systems. There is a strong desire for benchmarking and evaluating Cloud computing systems. Cloud
              computing provides service-oriented access to computing, storage and networking resource. On one hand, considering the number of Cloud computing providers and the different services each provider offers, Cloud users need benchmark
              information to select the best service and provider for their needs. On the other hand, Cloud providers and Cloud architects need benchmarking results to create optimized architectures. The problem is that Cloud is a very complex and
              dynamic environment. Therefore there are important differences between benchmarking in dynamic Cloud environment with traditional benchmarking methods in static systems. We have performed an initial research about benchmarking in Cloud
              and understand various challenges about creating and deploying Cloud benchmarking; and we found that the most important problem for Cloud users are data isolation, security and unreliable performance. Inference and performance isolation
              are other major challenges for developers and architects of Cloud systems.
