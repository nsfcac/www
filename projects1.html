              Availability of large quantities of renewable energy can break the cost curve for large scale computing. For most high performance computing centers, energy is a significant fraction of operating cost, and can reach up to approximately
              the same cost of com puting clusters over the lifetime of the equipment. Wind power and solar energy are increasingly available in the US and worldwide, but unlike previous sources of renewable energy such as hydroelectric plants, each
              of these has significantly variable availability and cost (sometimes even negative) throughout the day. To make best use of these sources of energy, data centers will need to be highly automated and preferably sited in remote locations
              near these sources to reduce transmission costs. This project will apply previous CAC work in data center automation, analytics, and control standards and methods to this problem.

              This project aims to develop accelerated solutions of Somewhat Homomorphic Encryption (SHE) based on the Ring Learning with Errors scheme (RLWE). Recent research has identified data movement between host and device as a critical
              performance bottleneck in RLWE-based SHE. Our work will leverage the recently introduced Unified Memory technology and the Coherent Accelerator Processor Interface (CAPI) to develop an algorithm for the organization and placement of
              data within a Hybrid Memory System (HMS). The algorithm will reduce the amount of data movement between the host and the device and overlap remote fetches with computation on the accelerator to minimize exposed latency. The decision of
              when to move data from host to device will be guided by a Machine Learning model. A semi-supervised classifier will be trained offline to learn the relationship between SHE computation and data access characteristics and placement
              configurations. The optimal configuration will then be selected at runtime via autotuning methods. In prior work, we have deployed ML-driven heuristics to optimize accelerated applications where it has yielded integer factor performance
              improvements.

              The advent of ‘smart’ infrastructure systems that integrate digital communications and controls, with human operators as beneficiaries have created more new vulnerabilities than would exist if the sub-systems were isolated from one
              another. Sophisticated cyberattacks can exploit these vulnerabilities to disrupt or even completely disable the operations of our critical infrastructures and their services. The recent embrace of Internet of Things (IoT), autonomous
              driving, and cloud computing will further exacerbate the cybersecurity problem. Anomaly based Intrusion Detection Systems (ABA-IDS) are the go-to approach to detect and secure this smart infrastructure. ABA-IDS heavily depend on
              accurate modeling of the normal behavior of the systems to detect attacks. This modeling of the normal behavior is performed using machine learning techniques. To address IoT security problem not only do we need to train models that are
              highly accurate in anomaly detection but also train models and use machine learning techniques that are highly scalable in order to detect abnormal behavior in large cluster of IoT devices. The main goal of this research project is to
              explore the use of GPUs and other parallel processing techniques to improve the performance (computational) of machine learning models to aid in secure IoT infrastructure.

              Disk arrays spread data across several disks and access them in parallel to increase data transfer rates and I/O rates. Disk arrays are, however, highly vulnerable to disk failures. One of the challenges facing RAID storage technology
              is the growing time needed to rebuild failed disks, which increases the risk of data loss and threatens the long-running data storage technology's viability. When a disk fails, one RAID controller and a handful of disks do all the
              recovery work while the other disks and RAID controllers are not involved in the recovery process. The time it takes to rebuild an 8 TB or larger disk drive can reach several days, depending on how busy the storage system and RAID group
              are. In this project, we will explore declustered RAID, machine learning enabled proactive disk data protection, and vectorized RAIDZ technologies on both HDD and SSD drives to develop always-on HPC storage systems.

              Monitoring data centers is challenging due to their size, complexity, and dynamic nature. This project proposes visual approaches for situational awareness and health monitoring of HPC systems. The visualization requirements are
              expanded on the following dimensions: HPC spatial layout, temporal domain (historical vs. real-time tracking), jobs scheduling data, and system health services such as temperature, fan speed, and power consumption. We therefore focus
              the following design goals: 1) Provides spatial and temporal overview across hosts and racks, 2) Allows system administrators to filter by time series features such as sudden changes in temperatures for system debugging,3) Inspects the
              correlation of system health services and job scheduling information in a single view and 4) Characterize the HPC systems using unsupervised learning and provide predictive analysis.

              capabilities based on RISC-V architecture with ABI compatibility(e.g.RV64 apps will execute without an issue),2)extended addressing must be flexible to support multiple target application spaces/system architectures, e.g. traditional
              data centers, clouds, HPC, etc.,and3)extended addressing must not rely upon any one virtual memory mechanism. The overall xBGAS project includes four major tasks: design and development of ISA extension, design and development of

              A common trend in Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) is to consider data structures based on graphs to analyze network traffic and attack patterns. Timely detecting a threat is fundamental to reduce the risk to which the system is

              The current cloud security techniques are mainly labor intensive, use signature based attack detection tools, and not flexible enough to handle the current cyberspace complexity, dynamism, and epidemic-style propagation of attacks.
              Furthermore, while the organization boundaries are gradually disappearing, it became infeasible to create a defendable perimeter. In addition, the insider attacks are still a major issue since they have access to the cloud services and
              even infrastructures. In this project, scalable and resilient cloud services will be prototyped and tested using a public cloud service such as Amazon AWS.

              Benchmarking of a system is a process of assessing its performance and other characteristics, to be able to compare them with other systems. There is a strong desire for benchmarking and evaluating Cloud computing systems. Cloud
              computing provides service-oriented access to computing, storage and networking resource. On one hand, considering the number of Cloud computing providers and the different services each provider offers, Cloud users need benchmark
              information to select the best service and provider for their needs. On the other hand, Cloud providers and Cloud architects need benchmarking results to create optimized architectures. The problem is that Cloud is a very complex and
              dynamic environment. Therefore there are important differences between benchmarking in dynamic Cloud environment with traditional benchmarking methods in static systems. We have performed an initial research about benchmarking in Cloud
              and understand various challenges about creating and deploying Cloud benchmarking; and we found that the most important problem for Cloud users are data isolation, security and unreliable performance. Inference and performance isolation
              are other major challenges for developers and architects of Cloud systems.

              Emerging large-scale applications on Cloud computing platform, such as information retrieval, data mining, online business, and social network, are data- rather than computation-intensive. Storage system is one of the most critical
              components for Cloud computing. The traditional hard disk drives (HDD) are current dominant storage devices in Clouds, but are notorious for long access latency and failure prone. The emerging storage class memory (SCM) such as Solid
              State Drives provides a new promising storage solution of high bandwidth, low latency, and mechanical component free, but with inherent limitations of small capacity, short lifetime, and high cost. The objective of this project is to
              build an innovative unified storage architecture (Unistore) with the co-existence and efficient integration of heterogeneous HDD and SCM devices for Cloud storage systems.

              The current cloud security techniques are mainly labor intensive, use signature based attack detection tools, and not flexible enough to handle the current cyberspace complexity, dynamism, and epidemic-style propagation of attacks.
              Furthermore, while the organization boundaries are gradually disappearing, it became infeasible to create a defendable perimeter. In addition, the insider attacks are still a major issue since they have access to the cloud services and
              even infrastructures. In this project, scalable and resilient cloud services will be prototyped and tested using a public cloud service such as Amazon AWS."

              Benchmarking of a system is a process of assessing its performance and other characteristics, to be able to compare them with other systems. There is a strong desire for benchmarking and evaluating Cloud computing systems. Cloud
              computing provides service-oriented access to computing, storage and networking resource. On one hand, considering the number of Cloud computing providers and the different services each provider offers, Cloud users need benchmark
              information to select the best service and provider for their needs. On the other hand, Cloud providers and Cloud architects need benchmarking results to create optimized architectures. The problem is that Cloud is a very complex and
              dynamic environment. Therefore there are important differences between benchmarking in dynamic Cloud environment with traditional benchmarking methods in static systems. We have performed an initial research about benchmarking in Cloud
              and understand various challenges about creating and deploying Cloud benchmarking; and we found that the most important problem for Cloud users are data isolation, security and unreliable performance. Inference and performance isolation
              are other major challenges for developers and architects of Cloud systems.

              Emerging large-scale applications on Cloud computing platform, such as information retrieval, data mining, online business, and social network, are data- rather than computation-intensive. Storage system is one of the most critical
              components for Cloud computing. The traditional hard disk drives (HDD) are current dominant storage devices in Clouds, but are notorious for long access latency and failure prone. The emerging storage class memory (SCM) such as Solid
              State Drives provides a new promising storage solution of high bandwidth, low latency, and mechanical component free, but with inherent limitations of small capacity, short lifetime, and high cost. The objective of this project is to
              build an innovative unified storage architecture (Unistore) with the co-existence and efficient integration of heterogeneous HDD and SCM devices for Cloud storage systems.
