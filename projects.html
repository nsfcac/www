One of the major research challenges is that some of the existing techniques of improving the correlated-failure durability sacrifices load balance, scalability, and numerous other features of the existing storage systems.

                  characteristics, to be able to compare them with other systems. There is a strong desire for
                  benchmarking and evaluating Cloud computing systems. Cloud computing provides service-oriented
                  access to computing, storage and networking resource. On one hand, considering the number of Cloud
                  computing providers and the different services each provider offers, Cloud users need benchmark
                  information to select the best service and provider for their needs. On the other hand, Cloud providers
                  and Cloud architects need benchmarking results to create optimized architectures. The problem is that
                  Cloud is a very complex and dynamic environment. Therefore there are important differences between
                  benchmarking in dynamic Cloud environment with traditional benchmarking methods in static systems.
                  We have performed an initial research about benchmarking in Cloud and understand various challenges
                  about creating and deploying Cloud benchmarking; and we found that the most important problem for
                  Cloud users are data isolation, security and unreliable performance. Inference and performance
                  isolation are other major challenges for developers and architects of Cloud systems.">Cloud Benchmarking & Performance

                  large-scale applications on Cloud computing platform, such as information retrieval, data mining, online
                  business, and social network, are data- rather than computation-intensive. Storage system is one of the
                  most critical components for Cloud computing. The traditional hard disk drives (HDD) are current dominant
                  storage devices in Clouds, but are notorious for long access latency and failure prone. The emerging
                  storage class memory (SCM) such as Solid State Drives provides a new promising storage solution of high
                  bandwidth, low latency, and mechanical component free, but with inherent limitations of small capacity,
                  short lifetime, and high cost. The objective of this project is to build an innovative unified storage

                    characteristics, to be able to compare them with other systems. There is a strong desire for
                    benchmarking and evaluating Cloud computing systems. Cloud computing provides service-oriented
                    access to computing, storage and networking resource. On one hand, considering the number of Cloud
                    computing providers and the different services each provider offers, Cloud users need benchmark
                    information to select the best service and provider for their needs. On the other hand, Cloud providers
                    and Cloud architects need benchmarking results to create optimized architectures. The problem is that
                    Cloud is a very complex and dynamic environment. Therefore there are important differences between
                    benchmarking in dynamic Cloud environment with traditional benchmarking methods in static systems.
                    We have performed an initial research about benchmarking in Cloud and understand various challenges
                    about creating and deploying Cloud benchmarking; and we found that the most important problem for
                    Cloud users are data isolation, security and unreliable performance. Inference and performance
                    isolation are other major challenges for developers and architects of Cloud systems.">Cloud Benchmarking & Performance
