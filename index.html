                    <h2>Technical Scope</h2>
                    <span>The scope of the CAC center broadly encompasses cloud computing systems at
                every level, including applications development and the use of autonomic
                computing methods for the management of these systems. CAC activities on cloud
                computing cut across several layers of IT systems, including: hardware platforms
                for computing, storage and networking; design of data centers that aggregate
                platforms to provide cloud services; systems software and distributed computing
                middleware providing programming interfaces and management primitives within and
                across multiple cloud data centers; applications that leverage the on-demand and
                scalable nature of cloud platforms; and cyber-security.</span>
                    <span>The CAC's current
                activities focus on improving methods, architectures and technologies for the
                design, implementation, integration and evaluation of computing systems and
                applications, especially in ways that are capable of achieving desired behaviors
                without the involvement of users or administrators. As a forefront research
                center at the intersection of cloud computing and autonomic computing, the CAC
                aims to promote automated advanced self-management capabilities within and
                across the layers of cloud and advanced distributed computing systems and
                applications in order to enable independent operation, minimize cost and risk,
                accommodate complexity and reduce technological uncertainty, and enable
                development of systems of systems with large numbers of components.</span>

                    <h2>Goals</h2>
                    <span>The primary goal of the CAC@TTU is to identify and foster industry-academia-government partnerships on topics
              directly related to emerging cloud infrastructures, software and standards, including issues related to security,
              performance,
              interoperability and workload portability across infrastructure boundaries. A related practical goal is to identify
              and develop coordinated efforts to organize, classify, and develop reference implementations and software that
              showcase the
              benefits of cloud and autonomic computing in areas of real-world applicability to business needs.
              Ranking equally with these is our goal to create a well-trained workforce through opportunities that relate
              the domain expertise of faculty
              and students to important problems and solutions in advanced distributed computing, cloud computing and
              autonomic computing that is capable of sustaining the activities and opportunities created through
              this joint effort.</span>

                An annual membership fee allows industry partners to reap the benefits of CACâ€™s full research
                program. CAC members from industry and government collaborate with and advise researchers to create a diverse,
                industry-relevant program that spans many different areas of work.
                Terms of membership are governed by a simple
                <a href="ttu_cac_membership.pdf">Center-wide membership agreement</a>
                and <a href="CACBylaws-1.1.pdf">associated bylaws</a>
                through which activities are directed by the members themselves
                by direct participation on an advisory board that selects projects and activities of the Center.</p>
            <p> Joining is as simple as filling out the <a href="ttu_cac_membership.pdf">Membership Agreement</a>,
                selecting the desired amount of membership and any auxiliary research you may want to pursue, and <a

            </p>
            <h3>More Information on Center Funding</h3>
            <p> Joining the Center puts you on the Industry Advisory Board (IAB) for the entire
                Center, which selects and approves research projects.
                <b>Members who join at the Executive level are allowed twice the number
                    of votes.</b></p>
            <p> Per National Science Foundation IUCRC program guidelines, industry and government contributions in
                the form of annual CAC memberships,
                coupled with baseline funds from NSF and university matching funds, directly support the Centerâ€™s
                expenses for personnel, equipment, travel, and supplies.
                A base membership is the minimum for voting.</p>
            <p> Memberships funds go directly to support the Centerâ€™s students, researchers and faculty for
                research and development activities.
                Additionally, the National Science Foundation and university provide funds and cost sharing to pay
                for administrative costs of operation,
                ensuring that these costs are covered separately and do not have to come out of membership fees.</p>
            <p> The work of the Center is carried out in the form of projects. Project selection is done by the IAB
                through a voting process.
                Projects can be funded through a single membership, but joint projects
                are encouraged by combining votes from multiple members to support projects with budgets that exceed
                individual membership amounts.
                Additional funding beyond memberships may also be supplied by member companies or organizations to
                speed up selected research.</p>
            <p> For special projects, it is also possible for any Center member to request to negotiate private
                research on a one-on-one basis beyond the projects funded by the membership fees. This opportunity
                is only available to member companies
                or organizations in good standing with existing memberships in the Center.</p>
            <p> Each regular membership is leveraged by the combined number of Center memberships, therefore
                multiplying its total value by a large factor.
                With present membership levels, for example, a single membership represents only a few percent of
                the total projected annual budget of the CAC,
                but yields access to the full range of Center activities, thus producing a research program at
                modest cost to your organization
                that would be much more expensive to pursue on your own using only internal resources. </p>
            <p> You also gain access to the
                state-of-the-art facilities and software environment provided by the Center, which is fully up to
                date with current best practices
                and would be much more expensive for your organization to produce on its own. Thus membership in the
                CAC represents extraordinary value that
                will accelerate your organization's progress towards its defined goals.

                  An annual membership fee allows industry partners to reap the benefits of CACâ€™s full research program. CAC members
                  from industry and government collaborate with and advise researchers to create a diverse, industry-relevant program that spans many
                  different areas of work.
                  Terms of membership are governed by a simple
                  <a href="ttu_cac_membership.pdf">Center-wide membership agreement</a>
                  and <a href="CACBylaws-1.1.pdf">associated bylaws</a>
                  through which activities are directed by the members themselves
                  by direct participation on an advisory board that selects projects and activities of the Center.</span>
                <span> Joining is as simple as filling out the <a href="ttu_cac_membership.pdf">Membership Agreement</a>, selecting the desired number
                  of memberships and any auxiliary research you may want to pursue, and <a href="mailto:cac.info@nsfcac.org">contacting us</a> to send it in.

                <h3>More Information on Center Funding</h3>
                <span> Joining the Center through any site puts you on the Industry Advisory Board (IAB) for the entire Center, which selects and approves research projects.
                  <b>Members who join at the Executive level (two memberships) or higher are allowed twice the number of votes.</b></span>
                <span> Per National Science Foundation I/UCEC program guidelines, industry and government contributions in the form of annual CAC memberships,
                  coupled with baseline funds from NSF and university matching funds, directly support the Centerâ€™s expenses for personnel, equipment, travel, and supplies.
                  A single membership is the minimum for voting, and multiple memberships are possible.</span>
                <span> Memberships funds go directly to support the Centerâ€™s graduate students and faculty supervision for research.
                  Additionally, the National Science Foundation and university provide funds and cost sharing to pay for administrative costs of operation,
                  ensuring that these costs are covered separately and do not have to come out of membership fees.</span>
                <span> The work of the Center is carried out in the form of projects. Project selection is done by the IAB through a voting process.
                  Projects can be funded through a single membership, but joint projects
                  are encouraged by combining votes from multiple members to support projects with budgets that exceed individual membership amounts.
                  Additional funding beyond memberships may also be supplied by member companies or organizations to speed up selected research.</span>
                <span> For special projects, it is also possible for any Center member to request to negotiate private
                  research on a one-on-one basis beyond the projects funded by the membership fees. This opportunity is only available to member companies
                  or organizations in good standing with existing memberships in the Center.</span>
                <span> Each regular membership is leveraged by the combined number of Center memberships, therefore multiplying its total value by a large factor.
                  With present membership levels, for example, a single membership represents only a few percent of the total projected annual budget of the CAC,
                  but yields access to the full range of Center activities, thus producing a research program at modest cost to your organization
                  that would be much more expensive to pursue on your own using only internal resources. </span>
                <span> You also gain access to the
                  state-of-the-art facilities and software environment provided by the Center, which is fully up to date with current best practices
                  and would be much more expensive for your organization to produce on its own. Thus membership in the CAC represents extraordinary value that
                  will accelerate your organization's progress towards its defined goals.
