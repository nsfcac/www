The main purpose of the program is to support and development of long-term partnerships among industry, academe, and government. The  IUCRC Centers are catalyzed by an investment from the National Science Foundation and their growth and impact are primarily realized through partnerships from industry members, with NSF taking the supporting role in the development and evolution of the Center. Each Center is established to conduct pre-competitive industry relevant R&D in unique expertise areas for increased industry engagement and support, new business development opportunities, and research capabilities of the Center faculty. Overall, the IUCRC program contributes to the nation’s research infrastructure base and enhances intellectual capacity of the engineering and science workforce through the integration of research and education. As appropriate, an IUCRC uses international collaborations to advance these goals within the global context.</p>

                    <h1>Technical Scope</h1>
                    <p>The scope of the CAC center broadly encompasses cloud computing systems at every level, including applications development and the use of autonomic computing methods for the management of these systems. CAC activities on cloud computing cut across several layers of IT systems, including: hardware platforms for computing, storage and networking; design of data centers that aggregate platforms to provide cloud services; systems software and distributed computing middleware providing programming interfaces and management primitives within and across multiple cloud data centers; applications that leverage the on-demand and scalable nature of cloud platforms; and cyber-security.</p>
                    <p>The CAC's current activities focus on improving methods, architectures and technologies for the design, implementation, integration and evaluation of computing systems and applications, especially in ways that are capable of achieving desired behaviors without the involvement of users or administrators. As a forefront research center at the intersection of cloud computing and autonomic computing, the CAC aims to promote automated advanced self-management capabilities within and across the layers of cloud and advanced distributed computing systems and applications in order to enable independent operation, minimize cost and risk, accommodate complexity and reduce technological uncertainty, and enable development of systems of systems with large numbers of components.</p>

                    <h1>Goals</h1>
                    <p>The primary goal of the CAC@TTU is to identify and foster industry-academia-government partnerships on topics directly related to emerging cloud infrastructures, software and standards, including issues related to security, performance, interoperability and workload portability across infrastructure boundaries. A related practical goal is to identify and develop coordinated efforts to organize, classify, and develop reference implementations and software that showcase the benefits of cloud and autonomic computing in areas of real-world applicability to business needs. Ranking equally with these is our goal to create a well-trained workforce through opportunities that relate the domain expertise of faculty and students to important problems and solutions in advanced distributed computing, cloud computing and autonomic computing that is capable of sustaining the activities and opportunities created through this joint effort.</p>

                        An annual membership fee allows industry partners to reap the benefits of CAC’s full research program. CAC members
                        from industry and government collaborate with and advise researchers to create a diverse, industry-relevant program that spans many
                        different areas of work.
                        Terms of membership are governed by a simple
                        <a href="ttu_cac_membership.pdf">Center-wide membership agreement</a>
                        and <a href="CACBylaws-1.1.pdf">associated bylaws</a>
                        through which activities are directed by the members themselves
                        by direct participation on an advisory board that selects projects and activities of the Center.</p>
                      <p> Joining is as simple as filling out the <a href="ttu_cac_membership.pdf">Membership Agreement</a>, selecting the desired number
                        of memberships and any auxiliary research you may want to pursue, and <a href="mailto:alan.sill@ttu.edu">contacting us</a> to send it in.
                        </p>

                    <h3>More Information on Center Funding</h3>
                      <p> Joining the Center through any site puts you on the Industry Advisory Board (IAB) for the entire Center, which selects and approves research projects.
                        <b>Members who join at the Executive level (two memberships) or higher are allowed twice the number of votes.</b></p>
                      <p> Per National Science Foundation I/UCEC program guidelines, industry and government contributions in the form of annual CAC memberships,
                        coupled with baseline funds from NSF and university matching funds, directly support the Center’s expenses for personnel, equipment, travel, and supplies.
                        A single membership is the minimum for voting, and multiple memberships are possible.</p>
                      <p> Memberships  funds  go directly to support the Center’s graduate students and faculty supervision for research.
                        Additionally, the National Science Foundation and university provide funds and cost sharing to pay for administrative costs of operation,
                        ensuring that these costs are covered separately and do not have to come out of membership fees.</p>
                      <p> The work of the Center is carried out in the form of projects. Project selection is done by the IAB through a voting process.
                        Projects can be funded through a single membership, but joint projects
                        are encouraged by combining votes from multiple members to support projects with budgets that exceed individual membership amounts.
                        Additional funding beyond memberships may also be supplied by member companies or organizations to speed up selected research.</p>
                      <p> For special projects, it is also possible for any Center member to request to negotiate private
                        research on a one-on-one basis beyond the projects funded by the membership fees. This opportunity is only available to member companies
                        or organizations in good standing with existing memberships in the Center.</p>
                      <p> Each regular membership is leveraged by the combined number of Center memberships, therefore multiplying its total value by a large factor.
                        With present membership levels, for example, a single membership represents only a few percent of the total projected annual budget of the CAC,
                        but yields access to the full range of Center activities, thus producing a research program at modest cost to your organization
                        that would be much more expensive to pursue on your own using only internal resources. </p>
                      <p> You also gain access to the
                        state-of-the-art facilities and software environment provided by the Center, which is fully up to date with current best practices
                        and would be much more expensive for your organization to produce on its own. Thus membership in the CAC represents extraordinary value that
                        will accelerate your organization's progress towards its defined goals.
