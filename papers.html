          <p>We designed a new data distribution algorithm called SUORA (Scalable and Uniform storage via Optimally-adaptive and
          Random number Addressing), to place data on heterogeneous environment. It divides heterogeneous devices into multiple
          buckets and assigns them to different segments in each bucket. The bucket can reflect the underlying distinct device
          characteristics and benefit for data movement based on data hotness and bucket threshold. The SUORA algorithm achieves
          goals in balanced performance, capacity, and cost for data placement by taking advantages of heterogeneous device
          characteristics.</p>
          <p>We designed a data replication scheme, namely pattern-directed replication scheme (PRS), to improve data access
          performance for object-based storage in heterogeneous environment. The basic idea of PRS is replicating identified object
          access pattern, grouping objects with temporal-based or hotness-based correlation, and reorganizing objects to reduce
          replicas.</p>

            The mission of each Cloud Plugfest is defined in advance to focus on particular aspects of software, standards or
            implementations in a collaborative setting, with active developers present or remotely connected to allow real-time testing
            and interchange regarding the results.
